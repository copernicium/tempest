How to Use Tempest

Tempest is an app designed to manage your appointments and other items on your general to-do list.

To begin, you first add a new item by hitting the "Add New" button. After doing so, you will be prompted to enter a name for the item, adjust its priority, and add an optional description. Then you can either save the item or cancel.

Now that you've created a few new items, you can do all sorts of things with them. You can scroll around them and view their details including the date they were created. From this description window, you have the ability to toggle the item's completion status as well as edit or delete it.

On the left, you also have the option to sort the items in the app by such things as name or creation date as well as filter them by certain criteria.

The app automatically saves your to-do list to the disk so you don't have to worry about losing your data when you close it.
